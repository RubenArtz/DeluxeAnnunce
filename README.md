# Deluxe Annunce
This is my best work which is based on sending messages through the skins of premium and non-premium players.

<h1 align="center">WARNING ABOUT USING THE PLUGIN IN BUNGEECORD</h1>

* In this version of bungeecord most features do not work like sounds, particles, firewrosk, bossbar, player skin contains bugs due to changes that occurred during bungeecord version 1.16 (no longer fixable).

* It is recommended to use spigot from 1.8.8 to 1.17.1, if you use 1.17x you will get the best experience of this great plugin due to the change in the chat, now you can see the player's skin in full color!
